# Password.Manager

## The perhaps best app on Android to store your passwords.

Developer of this nice app is @Clemens. 
So contact me if you want a new feature in this app.

## Current security features
- completly encrypted database with AES 256
- locks after three failed login tries
- no tracking by screenshotting or screenrecording

`SafeSavedPassSafe` would be a funny name...
